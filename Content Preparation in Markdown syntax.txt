## Document Inspiration

Being a North Indian, I was unconventionally born in South India. Although, New Delhi was where I spent most of my childhood. Ever since middle school I started playing with the creative arts whilst taking up photography first. I took a workshop in the North-East Indian State of Nagaland and followed it up by being a part of my school's Photography club. 

Later on I took up music production as a hobby, teaching myself the basics through Youtube using FL Studio, an industry favourite. That led me to learn video editing as well through softwares such as Sony Vegas Pro and Adobe After Effects which eventually forced me to learn graphic design for assets. 

And now, my primary interest lies in UI/UX Design, but more of the UI for apps side of it so far. I am still new to the process of UX research and hopefully my Sophomore year shall make me fluent in understanding the workings of the UX process.
