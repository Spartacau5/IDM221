## Document Inspiration
1)	https://medium.com
I find this site interesting because it somehow provides a very modern look on an old-fashioned English newspaper type design which for me engages users to keep reading more. The “Charter” and “Keivit” fonts help that aspect, apart from a simple and clean design with just the article and its info, nothing else. Last but not the least, the interactive clap icon is a joy to play with, and this makes the website memorable without overdoing it. 

2)	https://dubhacks.co

This site is one of the prettiest websites I have come across on the internet. Instantly, your attention is drawn by the dropdown of “DUBHACKS” written with some beautiful 3D isometric design of their college buildings. Scrolling down is smooth, with color and motion transitions filling the webpage and the relevant information, with more isometric campus buildings popping up. Moreover, I feel that it does fulfill the definition of a good website as well as apart from being aesthetically pleasing, it more importantly does the job of being the first introduction to people who wish to apply for Dubhacks.

This site is made by one of the seniors at my school who was one of the first who inspired me to chase design as a future. I like the website because for me it displays professionalism, a unique design sense, and succeeds playing the role of a crossover between a resume and a portfolio. It displays Namanyay’s excellence in a way which speaks volumes and provides a sense of credibility to his work. 

##Content Inventory 
I am Arpit Singh Ahluwalia, an Interactive Digital Media Sophomore at Drexel University. I am 19 years old, from New Delhi, India. My aim is to work  professionally for Spotify as a UI/UX Designer  and ultimately open up an Institute for Design back home in India. 

Being a North Indian, I was unconventionally born in South India. Although, New Delhi was where I spent most of my childhood. Ever since middle school I started playing with the creative arts whilst taking up photography first. I took a workshop in the North-East Indian State of Nagaland and followed it up by being a part of my school's Photography club. 

Later on I took up music production as a hobby, teaching myself the basics through Youtube using FL Studio, an industry favourite. That led me to learn video editing as well through softwares such as Sony Vegas Pro and Adobe After Effects which eventually forced me to learn graphic design for assets. 

And now, my primary interest lies in UI/UX Design, but more of the UI for apps side of it so far. I am still new to the process of UX research and hopefully my Sophomore year shall make me fluent in understanding the workings of the UX process.
